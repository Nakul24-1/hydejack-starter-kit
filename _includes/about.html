    <p>I have worked closely with the founder from when the project was 0, I was the lead
      and sole collab manager, I managed to do 65 + collabs in just time span of 4 weeks
      These included one of the biggest communities in the space. The project has mint on
      9th September and will get a mint out!! I also helped as an Advisor assisting the
      Founder with some planning on tweets, marketing strategy.</p>

    <p>I got in as collab manager very late just 72hrs before the mint but
      even with such a less time period, I managed to close 12 big collabs in just 48hrs
      one of the biggest and most reputated communities in the space! </p>

    <p>This is very similar post like Godjira but promoted level, I work here as
      a Internal collab manager where I bring wl spots from other projects, decide
      mutual spots count and also the execution part is under me. The community is
      super active and I have done multiple collabs and I will be working on the team
      for an unforseen future</p>
