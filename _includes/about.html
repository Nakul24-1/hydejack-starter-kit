  <h1>My Expertise</h1>

  <p>
    So, I am 17 yrs old, Commerce Student from India. I have been working in NFT space for some months now, I have
    helped several projects some of the notable ones mentioned below. I am very systematic person, Hardworking, Hungry
    to Achieve something big that's why grinding hard from this age!! I love to connect with new people and make friends
    either it be web 2 or web . I am also Fond of music and Games and I have a gaming channel ( Only for my Web 2 FAM ).
    This might be hypocritic but I love NFTs and hate NFTs at the same time, as I rarely mint any NFTs but I sell them
    ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>I have great experience in working as a Lead Collab Manager /Collab Manager/Advisor for several projects. I have
    helped my clients/projects get several collabs from the point when project is small to the point when it has become
    huge due to the collabs and other marketing efforts. I have connections in one the the most notable projects/alpha
    groups in the space, Total count of projects I am connected with would be 200 +. Many of the CMs in those
    projects/alphas are my friends and dope people!! . Enough about me, I guess ðŸ˜‚. </p>
  <br>
  <p>If you are a client looking for 1 spot destination for Collabs then shoot a DM on discord/Twitter DM Me!! </p>
  <p>If you are collab manager looking to do a collab contact my assistant SP17#9949 ( discord ).</p>

      Scout it is a big deal to be in part of the team. I am really grateful to Groot for
      seeing something in me and giving me the opportunity. I basically bring wl spots
      from other projects/early project to discussion with Brand Officers.</p>
