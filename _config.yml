  Hello! Thanks for taking time out and viewing my website! Really Glad that you find me interesting, I hope some girls also did ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚(jk). Lets move on.

  So, I am 17 yrs old, Commerce Student from India. I have been working in NFT 
  space for some months now, I have helped several projects some of the notable 
  ones mentioned below. I have great experience in working as a Lead Collab Manager
  /Collab Manager/Advisor for several projects. I have helped my clients/projects get
  several collabs from the point when project is small to the point when it has become 
  huge due to the collabs and other marketing efforts.I have connections in one the
  the most notable projects/alpha groups in the space, Total count of projects
  I am connected with would be 200 +. Many of the CMs in those projects/alphas
  are my friends and dope people!! I am very systematic person, Hardworking, Hungry to
  Achieve something big that's why grinding hard from this age!! I love to connect
  with new people and make friends either it be web 2 or web . I am also 
  Fond of music and Games and I have a gaming channel ( Only for my Web 2 FAM ).  
  This might be hypocritic but I love NFTs and hate NFTs at the same time, as I rarely
  mint any NFTs but I sell them ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
  Enough of me, I guess.

  If you are a client looking for 1 spot destination for Collabs then shoot a DM on discord/Twitter DM Me!!
